# gmxQTools
This repository provides tools and scripts for working with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS (e.g., PyMemDyn), as well as for performing simulations with Q (e.g., QligFEP) on the same molecular system. It includes tools for system preparation, simulation execution, results analysis, and more.
