# gmxQTools
This repository provides tools and scripts for working with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS (e.g., PyMemDyn), as well as for performing simulations with Q (e.g., QligFEP) on the same molecular system. It includes tools for system preparation, simulation execution, results analysis, and more.

All the scripts and the pipeline are optimized for batch processing of MD simulations, handling numerous ligands, folders, and proteins.

## GPCR Work Pipeline

This pipeline outlines the workflow for working with G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). All steps described below have been tested using Schr√∂dinger software (Maestro) for file preparation (protprep, ligprep), and docking.

### 1. Files preparation

#### 1.1 Excel to SDF Conversion

Quickly convert an Excel file containing IDs and SMILES to SDF format using `rpmol`. This can be done easily on your computer with a simple installation via pip:

```bash
pip install rpmol
```
After installation, you can convert xlsx files containing 'ID' and 'SMILES' columns to sdf. Also allows to convert sdf files to xlsx.
```bash
rpmol [file_to_convert]
```

The source code of rpmol is also included in this repository.

### 1.2 Protein and Ligand Preparation

In Maestro, protein and ligand preparation typically involve several steps to ensure proper structure and compatibility for molecular docking studies. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Protein Preparation**:
    - Import the protein structure (usually in PDB format).
    - Execute Protein Preparation tool in Maestro.

2. **Ligand Preparation**:
    - Import the ligand structures (sdf file generated before).
    - Execute Ligand Preparation tool in Maestro.

3. **Pymodsim centering**: As the GPCR will be embedded in a membrane, you first need to align the protein with it.
    - Export prepared protein as pdb file.
    - Follow the protocol of [PyModSim](https://github.com/GPCR-ModSim/pymodsim). For only alignment:

      ```bash
      pymodsim -n 3 -p [PDB]
      ```
      
4. **Grid generation and ligand docking**: Create a grid to your specific requirements, and then proceed with ligand docking.
   
5. **Export files**:
    - Export selected poses as pdb files.
    - Export GPCR as pdb file, save as protein.pdb.

6. **Prepare system for pymemdyn**: at this point you have multiple ligands (and/or diferent poses for same ligand) as pdb files with residue name 'UNK' and the protein.
   Execute 'setup_pym.py' in the directory containing all the files to create complexes between ligand and receptor, generate parameters of the ligands using [Ligpargen][https://github.com/Isra3l/ligpargen], and rename the files properly for pymemdyn.
      ```bash
      setup_pym [-C CLUSTER] [-l LIGAND]
                [-w WATERS] [-i IONS]
                [--full_relax FULL_RELAX]
                [--res RESTRAINT]
      Optional arguments (for executing pymemdyn after this preparation:

      -h, --help
                    show help message
      -l LIGAND
                    Ligand identifiers of ligands
                    present within the PDB file.
                    If multiple ligands are present,
                    give a comma-delimited list.
      
      -w WATERS
                    Water identifiers of crystalized
                    water molecules present within
                    the PDB file.
      -i IONS
                    Ion identifiers of crystalized water
                    molecules present within the PDB file.
      
      --res [RESTRAINT]
                    Position restraints during MD production
                    run. Options: bw (Ballesteros-Weinstein
                    Restrained Relaxation - default),
                    ca (C-Alpha Restrained Relaxation)

      --full_relax [True/False]
                    Toggle for performing full MD relaxation.
                    If set to false, the run will finish after
                    the initial relaxation. (default = True)
      ```

Edit the code for adding your own clusters.
    
This creates a folder for each ligand, executes ligpargen for ligand parameters and generate scripts for pymemdyn execution (pymemdyn.sh inside ligand folder and submit.sh for           submitting to a cluster SLURM queue.

### 2. Execute pymemdyn
Execute submit.sh file in your cluster.
Please check [PyMemDyn][https://github.com/GPCR-ModSim/pymemdyn] documentation for instalation. The arguments were included in submit.sh script in step 1.2.6.
