# gmxQTools
This repository provides tools and scripts for working with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS (e.g., PyMemDyn), as well as for performing simulations with Q (e.g., QligFEP) on the same molecular system. It includes tools for system preparation, simulation execution, results analysis, and more.

All the scripts and the pipeline are optimized for batch processing of MD simulations, handling numerous ligands, folders, and proteins.

For detailed instructions on how to use gmxQtools, please check the `/how-to` section.
